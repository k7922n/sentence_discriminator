hi
I'm well.
I'm Trump. You look so Blue.
Trump. You're Blue.
...Thank you so much.
That's so nice.
Isn't he a great guy.
He doesn't get a fair press; he doesn't get it.
It's just not fair.
Also, also the people of Iowa.
They have something in common.
Hard-working people.
I love the people of Iowa.
So that's the way it is.
Very simple.
Very simple.
Politicians are all talk, no action.
They are all talk and no action.
And it's constant; it never ends.
And I'm very disappointed by our Republican politicians.
Because they let the president get away with absolute murder.
Nothing ever happens; nothing ever happens.
You look at Obamacare.
People are closing up shops.
Doctors are quitting the business.
He said, I have more accountants than I have patients.
And he was very successful guy.
But it's happening more and more.
Look at Obamacare with a $5 billion website.
I have many websites, many, many websites.
They're all over the place.
But for $10, okay?
Now everything about Obamacare was a lie.
It was a filthy lie.
You can keep your plan.
And you've all heard that hundreds of times.
That's like the real estate location, location.
But you have heard this about Obamacare.
And it's disgraceful.
It's a big, fat, horrible lie.
Your deductibles are going through the roof.
So it's a real, real disaster.
And somebody has to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Now, we have to build a fence.
And it's got to be a beauty.
Fences are easy, believe me.
They're walking.
It is so terrible.
It is so unfair.
It is so incompetent.
And we don't have the best coming in.
You can certainly have terrorists.
You can certainly have Islamic terrorists.
You can have anything coming across the border.
We don't do anything about it.
Benghazi.
Oh, Benghazi, Benghazi.
Everything is Benghazi.
What happens?  Nothing.
IRS, e-mails.
I get sued all the time, okay.
I run a big business.
I have done so many deals.
Almost all of them have been tremendously successful.
You'll see that when I file my statements.
He never did a deal.
He did one deal.
A house.
He got away with murder.
But I can tell you, e-mails.
But they talk about it.
Nobody even heard of an executive order.
So we have to do something.
Jobs.
China.
And I know them.
We can't believe how stupid your leaders are.
They tell me that.
But they tell me that.
The Euro, China is going crazy with the devaluation.
They are devaluing down to nothing.
And they're getting away with it.
But you watch this devaluation of all of it.
I mean the Euro, China, Mexico; everybody is devaluing.
You know it's one of those things, sounds good.
Be very careful.
Be very careful.
They have it set.
Don't forget another thing.
China became the number one economic power a year ago.
It was absolutely unthinkable.
So it happened and it's very, very sad.
Now we spent $2 trillion in Iraq.
We got nothing.
By the way, you know how they formed.
They took the oil.
So now ISIS has the oil.
So we get nothing.
We have incompetent people.
It needs money.
We can't let Iran get a nuclear weapon.
We can't do it.
Can't do it.
We cannot let that happen.
Here we are in Syria.
We're fighting people that want to overturn Syria.
Think of this.
We're fighting ISIS, but ISIS wants to overturn the government.
But think of it; think of it.
There are so many things; there are so many things.
Trump. You need a cup of sugar
Are you a robot? I will win!
How are you doing ?
Nuclear today, it's not like soldiers in uniforms shooting rifles.
The power.
We've never had this before.
We're trying to do the right thing.
We have leadership, again--no leadership respects us.
The same thing is happening there.
They're taking it out.
Trillion of dollars and millions of dollars of minerals.
It's really, really crazy.
Bridges are collapsing all over the country.
I go to various different places.
I go to China.
They are building a bridge on every corner.
They're building the most incredible things you have ever seen.
The place is falling apart.
This is inside, not outside.
I said it's not an honor; they're just smart.
You know the guard rails.
Now they've been selling this thing for 25 years.
Why doesn't someone stop them and get something that works.
Because they don't know; they don't know what's happening.
Somebody made a lot of money on that.
They don't know what is happening.
So we have to make our country great again.
We have to rebuild our country.
And we have a long way to go.
We owe it to other countries.
They're the ones that hold the debt.
And then we give them money.
Now, we have a very important election coming up.
Nobody like Trump of course, but these are minor details.
We have some good people.
It' can't be Mitt because Mitt ran and failed.
He failed.
I mean I liked him.
The Romneycare from Massachusetts, that's not going away.
But more importantly, he choked.
Something happened to him in the last month.
He had that election won.
And let me tell you something.
And there are many of them.
I really do.
So you can't have Romney.
He choked.
You can't have Bush.
The last thing we need is another Bush.
But I said it.
The last thing we need is another Bush.
But he's totally in favor of Common Core.
He's very, very weak on immigration.
Don't forget--remember his statement--they come for love.
And then he appointed Justice Roberts.
And Jeb wanted Justice Roberts.
So you can't have Jeb Bush.
So Mitt and--you just can't have those two.
That's it.
That's it.
It's so simple.
He is reading it.
I mean give me a break.
Everything is read.
And that's what we ended up getting--the king of teleprompters.
But we have to do something about these teleprompters.
And you'll see that.
An incredible company; a wonderful company.
We have such great potential.
creating jobs;
reducing the budget deficit--so important, have to do it;
securing our Southern border--and I mean seriously securing it;
stopping nuclear weapons in Iran and elsewhere;
And everybody can be covered.
I'm not saying leave 50-percent of the people out.
Nobody knows.
I just got the best hotel in North America.
Do you believe that?  And everybody wanted it.
So, I can't believe it myself.
But it's going to be fantastic;
and so many other things.
We can make this country great again.
The potential is enormous.
Thank you very much, everybody.
Beautiful.
We should work — thank you.
Wow. Whoa. That is some group of people. Thousands.
We have a disaster called the big lie: Obamacare. Obamacare.
And we also need a cheerleader.
He’s not a leader. That’s true. You’re right about that.
So ladies and gentlemen...
I am officially running...
He said, "You know, I make great product."
I said, "They send it back?"
But I have another one, Ford.
So I announced that I’m running for president. I would...
So under President Trump, here’s what would happen:
So — because we got to make the country rich.
But here’s what’s going to happen:
They’re right about that, but I’m doing it.
So the total is $8,737,540,00.
Now I’m not doing that...
Fully support and back up the Second Amendment.
I said, "Very interesting."
So protect the Second Amendment.
Rebuild the country’s infrastructure.
Renegotiate our foreign trade deals.
Chris, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
It’s really been — it’s really been great.
Yes, go ahead.
Yeah, go ahead, finish it.
Yes, go ahead.
Yes, go ahead.
Yes?
Yes, go ahead.
OK, one or two more questions. Yeah, go ahead, Jeremy
You know, we’re having a celebration.
Thank you very much everybody. Thank you.
This is so — so incredible. —
No, no. I have guys ...
PBS, Public Broadcasting System — 69 percent said Trump won.
Right? There is none. There is none.
When I say...
Made in America.
Remember this, radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti- American.
Thank you for joining me today.
The horror is beyond description.
This is a very dark moment in America’s history.
Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.
All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.
The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.
I refuse to be politically correct.
These Departments refused to comply.
We can't let this happen.
I don’t want them in our country.
It also means we must change our foreign policy.
America will be a tolerant and open society.
America will also be a safe society.
We will protect our borders at home.
We will defeat ISIS overseas.
We will make America rich again.
We will make America safe again.
We will make American Great Again.
And it affects Iowa so much.
Obamacare’s dead but we’ll terminate it quicker than that.
So, we’re going to take care of that.
What happened is with Paris, there’s a different mindset.
But they’d say, "That’s it. It’s over."
And then we have another coming where we’re doing well.
But I only like polls that treat me well.
And so it’s very important for me to win Iowa.
I love you people. Remember that. Remember that.
That’s not going to happen with me.
And it’s going to work. And walls do work.
We have people that don’t know what they’re doing.
...I’m a big Second Amendment person by the way.
And I’m not. I’m totally in favor.
You know, if that industry is upset, Iowa’s got problems.
No, but I’m totally for it. Okay? Thank you.
...I’m such a believer in education.
We’re under-budget and ahead of schedule. That’s what we do.
So, we’re going to bring our jobs back. Okay?
Wow! Thank you very much.
Hello.
I’m truly honored by your support.
This is a great feeling. That’s a great feeling.
I’ve visited the crumbling cities and the struggling schools.
It’s important to understand what America First means.
Better hope I’m president.
We’ve started working already on the convention.
And I think it’s going to be very interesting.
So that’s the way it is...
But the money has been paid out.
Okay. Are you ready?
Are you ready? Do you have your pad?
So you have 22 Kill and that’s $200,000.
Ready?
22Kill got $200,000.
American Hero Adventures – $100,000.
Americans for Equal Living – $100,000.
America’s Vetdogs – The Veterans’ K-9 Corps Inc. – $75,000.
AMVETS – $75,000.
This is my check for $1 million.
Nobody gave this kind of money.
Well, generally speaking, that’s 100% true.
That’s right. I do raise millions.
No, I don’t think so.
...Honestly, it’s dishonest reporting.
Veteran:
They are using veterans as political pawns. It must stop.
It’s a complicated process.
Nothing in our country works anymore. It’s a mess.
These people are living in hell.
If you’re asking me who I prefer running against?
Because I don’t care...
I have a judge who’s very, very unfair.
It’s wrong. It’s wrong. I didn’t get 30%.
My last score was 78%. I didn’t get 30%.
I don’t know. No, no, no.
Here’s the way I look at it.
Now, what would I say good about Mitt Romney?
No, not all of you. Just many of you.
Well, thank you very much everyone.
It was a tremendous victory.
And we’re going to change it around.
And that’s not going to happen.
The work has been unreal.
Okay, thank you all very much.
We pay for everybody else’s military.
We don’t know what we’re doing.
Oh, Hillary. Ayeyeye. "Take care of Hillary."
This could be the all-time great Trojan horse. Who knows?
Right?
And we need borders and we’re going to have borders.
Pfizer is moving to Ireland.
The economy is not good. The economy is bad.
Boy, he is bad.
And you know what? I’m the first one.
And so I said number one, it’s obsolete.
Here’s the story, folks.
And he just kept going back.
So we have people that don’t know what they’re doing.
I’ll give you one good example.
So he is the worst negotiator worldwide.
We’ve got to stop it. We’ve got to stop it.
So, we have to be taken care of.
We don’t have a country that can do this anymore.
Can you imagine? She was Person of the Year.
So here’s the story. Here’s the story.
I have the greatest people in the world for dealing.
...I love you too. Thank you.
Really do. I love the people. I love the people.
800,000 food stamp recipients.
It goes on and on.
Wisconsin has lost 15,000 net jobs to Mexico since NAFTA.
...But the motorcycle guys love Trump.
What is it about Trump that they like?
I said, "These are great people. Don’t worry about it."
But listen, I appreciate it, fellas, I appreciate it.
Because we’re getting rid of ISIS.
You lost 70,000 jobs to China. 70,000 jobs.
Look, I don’t know. I don’t know.
We’ve rebuilt China. I mean, we’re rebuilding Mexico.
And it’s been an amazing time.
And I hit Rand, Rand, old Rand.
I said, "Who do you want as your president?"
But I just love you. I don’t care about that.
So what happens – thank you.
We have a country that’s not protected.
But when Jerry was so strong and so great.
They’ve actually taken their right of free speech away.
But they’re not allowed to talk because they’re petrified.
I like everybody I defeat.
So believe me, believe me, they’re all establishment.
Nobody better than Jeff.
Cruz has not accomplished one thing.
You know, China does not obey the rules.
But our leaders are doing a bad job for us.
But just remember, they’re not so stupid like you think.
22 veterans a day commit suicide. That’s correct.
You see the corruptness.
Go ahead.
Women – what did you think? [Audience response inaudible]...
...It’s horrible. It’s horrible. Honestly, it’s horrible.
[Audience response inaudible]
[Audience response inaudible]
They’re going to destroy a man’s life?
We’re going to win because of Wisconsin, I hope...
Okay. I can see why.
And are you coming along okay?
That’s so nice. Thank you.
But these guys run for office. That’s all they do.
And I said, "How it is possible to win?"
They just announced North Carolina.
Florida was so amazing.
Actually now according to the Economist, I’m at 53%.
But I’ve had very good relationships with pretty much everybody.
We have a lot of events scheduled, yes.
My brand’s doing great. Yeah.
So we have – there’s a good bonding going on.
Well, I enjoyed it.
Yeah, I look forward to it.
Well, we’re adding some and we’re adding them pretty rapidly.
No, but I’d love to finish first.
Okay?
We’ll go ahead.
But we’ve had an incredible time.
So I think those are two very bad points frankly.
Georgia just came out. I have 33%.
But people are fed up.
So anyways, I wish him the best.
Me, I’m going to do the right thing.
Jeb has spent now $77 million. Think of it.
So it’s been a real focus.
(AUDIENCE MEMBERS SHOUTING)
Wow. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you.
We start by paying our great respects to Pearl Harbor.
She’s got no strength. She’s got no stamina. Remember that.
Do you think Gen. George Patton would be interviewed?
…They’d be interviewed after total and complete victory.
These guys – and I don’t think we’ll have to.
These people are living in a different planet. Different planet.
Shall I read you the statement?
So I said, "All right. Let’s take it."
And now, illegal immigration is one of the biggest things.
And this is the kind of mindset you need.
And we don’t even get our prisoners back.
It’s very sad. It’s very sad.
Can you imagine I got the approval?
…
I think it will be one of the great catastrophes.
For a person like me, I mean, it’s very exciting.
There’s total hatred and there’s total gridlock.
But we need Patton. We need a genius like MacArthur.
To me, it was instructional.
So I’m looking forward to getting to the signings.
…
Look, nobody can negotiate trade deals like me.
With that being said, I don’t really care.
So somebody said, "How did they get there?"
Jeb – he lacks the quality that you need.
Well, we’re going to stage something properly also.
Sounds okay to me.
What happened is he got out.
And we’ve seen it.
So you know it’s great.
All of these incredible places that I have.
And here, we accept all of their products.
We have a $70 billion trade imbalance with Japan.
And the reason is bureaucracy. It’s very hard.
I happen to believe it’s more than $2.5 trillion.
And we’re going to make it nice and simple.
And we’re getting rid of a lot of things.
So we’re going to have a nice simple tax return.
Somebody said "Oh, why isn’t everybody paying?"
It’s going to end. It’s going to end.
But I’d love it if we made them.
We totally destabilized the Middle East. We totally blew it.
I said "No, no, tell me please."
So go back. So the world is unpredictable.
They don’t know it’s unpredictability. They don’t know it’s strategy.
We lose with the military. ISIS beats us. Everybody.
We lose with trade.
And we aren’t supposed to call them or anything. Okay.
But it was a wall and they didn’t deal.
Bush, it’s the same thing.
Okay, let’s do a couple of questions. Right? Come on.
Our jobs have been taken away.
But that’s an amazing stat.
And Hillary should have approved it.
So I would approve it.
We will support Israel 1,000%.
We are going to stop drugs.
And Mexico is not helping us. Mexico is not helping.
It eliminates the AMT, which is the alternative minimum tax.
Now, it’s called corporate inversion. It’s a huge subject.
The number is probably $2.5 trillion.
Everybody agrees it should come back – Republicans, Democrats, everybody.
It’s called leadership.
We will have that money brought back in.
And this is my wheelhouse. That’s what I do well.
So, they’re very conservative numbers.
We want to simplify them to a tremendous level.
It’s going to create tremendous numbers of jobs.
We lose money with everything.
So we need help.
I’m funding my own campaign.
No, not at all. We’re lowering taxes, which Republicans love.
So, no, that’s not true.
And I think it will be an amazing boon.
I fight like hell always because it’s an expense.
That number is so false.
There’s anger out there at the job picture.
All of that will stop.
I know nothing about that.
Autism has become an epidemic.
It has gotten totally out of control.
I didn’t expect it. I didn’t ask for it.
So, Joe, I just really appreciate it. So unexpected.
So we’re going to see what happens.
So let’s start with China. Almost $400 billion a year.
Not going to happen anymore. Not going to happen anymore.
It’s not going to happen that way anymore.
It’s just going to be more of the same.
So, we are going to make our country so great.
We are going to take care of our veterans.
They’re disgusted with our incompetent politicians.
They’re disgusted by what’s happening to our country.
Believe me, we will make our country great again.
I love you all. Thank you very much.
And for that reason, I have signed the pledge.
Yeah, I got nothing. I really got nothing.
No, I have no intention of changing my mind.
So that was very important.
So I think it’s more appropriate to be speaking English.
When people come illegally, we cannot allow that.
And we will make sure that that takes place.
I don’t want to talk about that. It’s inappropriate.
Nothing works. Our country doesn’t work.
But I think it depends on what happens with her.
Who knows?
But he’s been so nice to me.
It’s going to end and they’re going to like us.
Beada, where are you Beada? Look at her. So beautiful.
And we’ll talk about the polls in a second.
They’re actually very nice.
You know, we’re in age of Obamacare where nothing exists.
It’s amazing. Isn’t it amazing? Don’t you agree?
I won’t happen to me, I promise.
Japan’s taking our money.
But you know, I’m leading big in Florida.
"But there are some people that don’t like him."
So anyways, who cares.
Called it "astounding." Nobody else wrote about it.
And we are more than double everybody.
We can save our country. We can save our country.
But it’s too bad. Too bad. Well, thank you.
So, we’re going to take back our trade.
And we’ve got to be smart.
But they say, "He’ll never file. He’ll never file."
You have not been treated fairly.
It’s anchor baby.
I got credit. I got credit.
And then you wonder why there’s crimes in our cities.
So one of the biggest beneficiaries is Russia. Okay?
Nice, right? I know, nice.
You’ve got to teach them how to behave, right?
What a difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Mike Pence.
And what we're doing...
But our workers’ loyalty was repaid with betrayal.
Many of these areas have still never recovered.
This wave of globalization has wiped out our middle class.
The inner cities will remain poor.
The factories will remain closed.
The borders will remain open.
The special interests will remain firmly in control.
